Testing Code happens within three different levels
    1) Unit Tests
        Fastest
        Cheapest
        Smallest
        Catches human errors
    2) Service Tests
        Slower
        Take more time to write and run
        Can be more thorough
        Integration testing
        API testing
    3) UI Tests
        Expensive
        Powerful; Tests hundreds of functions
        Use something like Cypress
        Takes lots of time to create and run

Build Pipeline
    GitHub
        git push
        main branch
        tributary branches
        pull requests
        git merge main
        git push -u origin "tributary branch"
    CICD - Continuous Integration Continuous Deployment/Delivery
        goes to customers/consumers/coworkers

(26 Jan 2023) Notes:
    CIT students who understand business structure are so valuable
        - Solutions with IT problems in a business setting (having good business conversation)
    People need a tech team that can talk with them (soft skills, problem-solving skills)
    Being able to work with a team (group teamwork)
    Within the Cloud = Containerization (application moderation) --> mobility
    Students should focus on Azure, AWS, etc. (AWS certs)
        - Cert in AWS is more important than 4yr degree (typically)
    Marry certs, degree, business skills, etc.
    Competition is global community -- but soft skills is vital!
        - Be able to work with people outside of IT
        - Be able to be a Leader and be fearless (leap in with Faith, courage mentality)
            >> Especially with an ORANGE Personality (in the Business world):
                + Be willing to FAIL, and fail hard
                + Be vulnerable, be experimental & fearless
                + Be willing to go wherever the future needs to be
                + Be a trail-blazer, pioneer, future-focused (not to a mental strain personally)
        - Be good with writing (communicate with business people; don't make people feel dumb, dumb info down)
    Writing skills are also crucial (propose ideas with 6-page narrative)
        - Writing so people can understand
        - Take complex ideas and translate them to simple language in writing format
    PR FAQ (Press Release Frequently Asked Questions) -- understand it; do it
    "How is AWS approaching the market and helping customers?"
        - Optimization
    Have a skill that relates to something - be able to do something
        - Be a critical thinker (also have the certs)
        - Solve problems
        - Communicate/write how to solve problems
    Any Cert of AWS is good!
    Change is either something to fear or to embrace
        - Involves utilizing foundational skills/knowledge into new concepts/technologies
    Kindness, Mental Health, etc. are soft skills that are crucial, critical, and key!
