Testing Code happens within three different levels
    1) Unit Tests
        Fastest
        Cheapest
        Smallest
        Catches human errors
    2) Service Tests
        Slower
        Take more time to write and run
        Can be more thorough
        Integration testing
        API testing
    3) UI Tests
        Expensive
        Powerful; Tests hundreds of functions
        Use something like Cypress
        Takes lots of time to create and run
